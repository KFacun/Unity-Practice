# Bullying Yaga
I created a block in Unity called 'Yaga' and bullying him through traps I coded as though he was a character in a game. I wanted to find out how games are processed through Unity and what it takes to create games and I guess, "events" in your game. 

Day 1: Implemented movement onto a cube named 'Yaga'.

Day 2: Implemented health onto Yaga so they can feel pain.
